# Deployment Day

#### Verse 1

All the stress and all the bugs, pop-up every two weeks  
Memory leaks, performance peaks, fuck this modern techniques  

Sprint is over, demo planned, and you are still awake  
Nervous shake, pipelines break, again a stupid mistake  

#### Refrain

Prod release is even worse, it feels like doomsday  
Welcome to Deployment Day  

#### Bridge

Review tomorrow, all the pressure today
Yeah, it is again deployment day

#### Verse 2

Code reviews and merge conflicts, endless git debates.  
Terminal windows, and more info, someone please hit the brakes  

Product owners changing scope, priorities shift each day.  
Deadlines loom, expectations boom, can we just replay?
