# Mr. Incognito

#### Refrain 

Tell it to Mr Incognito  
The Guy you can trust so, nobody knows  
Uh, Uh, Uh… - I’m ready to go….

#### Verse 1

Ain’t leave no trace in the world wide web  
Don’t want your wife to check the depth  
Of your browser history

Took the wrong turn not once or twice  
Don’t be a fool take my advice  
The invisible man that no one sees

#### Verse 2

Not only your partner in crime  
Takes care of your valuable time  
Stays always at your side

He helps you with your cookie mess  
A nice clean start to do your test  
The invisible man in every Byte

#### Bridge

You can trust me I’m your friend - yeah  
You can trust me I’m your friend – yeah  
You can trust me I’m your friend – yeah  
You can trust me I’m your friend – yeah
