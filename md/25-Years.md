# 25 Years

#### Verse 1

It`s been 25 years, always ready to go  
My ass got fat, my hair fell out, but now …  
I'm ready for the show  
Gaming was my first big love  
And since then, I played all of them, but now …  
I feel a bit slow  

#### Verse 2

With fifteen years I had too much time  
Downloading was not a crime, oh man …  
What an awesome time back then  
FTP my protocol  
No matter of your firewall, I see …  
I was a major wannabe  

#### Refrain

I was a ninja looter, camping shooter  
Lowlife with a crap computer  
Uuuuhhh aaaaaah bap bap badada  

#### Verse 3

Counter-Strike, oh yeah, I like  
Battlefield, in my room sealed, fist bump  
Let's do a Rocket jump  
The boy grew up to a man  
But still remains a star wars fan, that's true  
May the force be with you
