# Pre-Programmed Love Affair

#### Verse 1

Today, her first day, she will surprise you!  
She joined a dev team, will engineer, too  
In her team are only men, sexist jokes, now and then  
They know it all cause they are men  

She's a first class engineer, totally into  
Writing unit tests, clean code, yes she will do  
She knows every principle, programs like invincible  
She kicks ass and goes her way  

#### Refrain

Romantic in my software  
Updates for my hardware  
Pre-Programmed Love Affair  

Romantic in my software  
Updates for my hardware  
Pre-Programmed Love Affair  

#### Verse 2

There is another one, I want to tell you  
A big master chief - no, no, no nothing new  
The one and only engineer, a man, I want to mention here  
He knows it all , 'cause he's a man  

It will not surprise you, that these two  
Had a lot of fights, that they went through  
But miracles from time to time  
Happens and now all is fine  
Pair-programming, love and plug & play
